## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS @media Rule

### What I learned and need to continue focusing on

Throughout this project I learned more about the CSS Flexbox layout as well as how to make the design respond to the size of the user's device.
I hope to improve my knowledge get a better understanding of how to use different properties as I work on diverse projects/challenges.

### Useful resources
